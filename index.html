        <p>Clavaa is the newest, and most rewarding way to pay. It replaces your cashback cards with a more rewarding seamless experience -- we throw away the standard 1.5% cashback and allow our local businesses to give back multiples of that to you in cashback to their store--get up to 3 times the standard rewards.

        <div class="questions" id="questions-1"><h6>How secure is Clavaa?</h6><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i><p>Clavaa is a secure and easy-to-use mobile payment method that allows you to pay at stores and online by simply scanning a QR code. To get started, sign up for Clavaa through the app or website, and link your bank account using Plaid.

            With Clavaa, your bank account number and identity are not shared with merchants and your bank account numbers aren’t stored on your device or on our servers, making it safer than using a physical credit, debit, or prepaid card. Additionally, when you pay in stores, neither Clavaa nor your device will send your actual card number to merchants, and when you pay online, the merchant will only receive the information necessary to fulfill your order, such as your name, email address, and billing and shipping addresses.</p></div>
        <div class="questions" id="questions-2"><h6>Which Banks allow Clavaa?</i></h6><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i><p> Clavaa works with almost every single bank that has a connection to Plaid, and there is no extra cost to use it. If you don't see your bank listed, please contact us for assistance. </p></div>
        <div class="questions" id="questions-3"><h6>How much cashback can I earn?</h6> <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i><p>The cashback you earn by using Clavaa will vary depending on each merchant, with a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 10%. We strive to maximize the amount our customers earn.</p></div>
        <div class="questions" id="questions-4"><h6>Can I use credit cards for payments</i></h6><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i><p>Currently, Clavaa only accepts bank account for payment, but we are planning to implement a credit card feature in the future.</p></div>
        <div class="questions" id="questions-5"><h6>When will Clavaa be available across the US</h6><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i><p>We are working hard to rollout Clavaa for very bussiness in the US. Keep on the lookout for when we launch across the US</p></div>
        <div class="questions" id="questions-6"><h6>How can I contact Clavaa?</h6><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i><p>You can send us an email at questions@Clavaa.com for all questions and comments.</p></div>
